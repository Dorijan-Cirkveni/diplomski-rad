Imagine you're in charge of guiding a virtual agent through a 2D grid-based environment.
The grid consists of various tiles:
- 'X' denotes invisible tiles
- numbers represent different types of tiles
- an agent is represented by 'E'
Your goal is to analyze each environment and suggest the appropriate action for the agent to take,
considering the layout, obstacles, and other relevant information.

Here's how it works:

'X': Unknown tile
'0': Empty tile
'1': Goal tile
'2': Wall tile
'E': Agent
Your task is to provide an integer representing the desired direction for the agent's next move:

0: Move up
1: Move down
2: Move left
3: Move right
4: Do nothing
No diagonal movements are allowed.

Now, let's analyze the environment and determine the best action for the agent!
